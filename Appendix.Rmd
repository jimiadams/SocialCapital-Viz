This document provides further details and justification for some of the analytic decisions made in the primary manuscript. We also provide some additional ancillary descriptive characteristics of our analytic corpus and results.

First, some basic information about the scope of the corpus and constructed networks.

  - Number of papers in corpus: 21,160
  - Total citations: 985,749 (to 533,111 unique papers)
  - Giant component [@Harary:1969] size in citation network: 546,159 (only drops 4,073 papers from focal corpus)
  - Citations in GC: 981,875 (to 529,244 unique papers)
  
For conducting the community structure analyses on this citation network, the paper presents results using [@Blondel:2008aa], but we also ran all analyses using [@Clauset2004]. In the summaries in this SI, we include both, and also elaborate the demosntrated demonstrated similarities and differences between these strategies. After applying the community detection algorithms on the citation giant component, we have: 
  
  - Number of papers in components size>10k
    - fast-greedy solution: 307,977
    - louvain solution: 304,163
    
  - Size of those components in the louvain solution
    - 
    
Identifying the "top citations" (receiving >= 1k citations within the corpus):

How many citations are there to the set of those top citations in the largest citation clusters?
  - Raw count: 681  777  868  354  427 1929 2886 6022 4306 1656 
  - As a proportion of citations sent within those clusters: 
  
Which communities are each of the top_cites in (recognizing this isn't the question here)? 

  - In FG solution, they're all in the same community. 
  - In louvain, they are in five separate communities
      - {adler, burt, coleman_1990, granovetter, nahapiet}
      - {bourdieu, lin, putnam_2000}
      - {coleman_1988}
      - {portes, putnam_1995, putnam_1993}).
